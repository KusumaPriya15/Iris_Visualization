# Iris Dataset Visualization
This document focuses on data visualization techniques using Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. You will explore relationships between different features of the Iris dataset, a widely used dataset for classification problems.

#### Introduction to Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is widely used for data plotting and provides flexibility and control over the appearance of visualizations.

Key Features:
- High-quality 2D and 3D plots.
- Extensive customization options (color, labels, grids, etc.).
- Integration with other libraries like NumPy and pandas.
  
Common Plot Types:
- Line plots for continuous data.
- Scatter plots to visualize relationships between numerical variables.
- Histograms to understand data distributions.

#### Introduction to Seaborn
Seaborn is a data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It simplifies the process of creating complex and informative visualizations and works seamlessly with pandas data frames.

Key Features:
- Automatic handling of data frames and statistical plotting.
- Built-in aesthetic themes for readability and visual appeal.
- Minimal code for complex plots like violin plots, pair plots, and heatmaps.

Common Plot Types:
- Pair plots to show pairwise relationships in a dataset.
- Box plots and violin plots for visualizing data distributions.
- Heatmaps to visualize correlations between variables.
### Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 observations from 3 species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). Each observation contains the following features:
- sepal length (cm)
- sepal width (cm)
- petal length (cm)
- petal width (cm)
